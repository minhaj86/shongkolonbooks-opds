You do not need hosting from GoDaddy. I have GoDaddy and I host with EC2. It is very simple to set up a website on EC2 and link it to a GoDaddy domain. Here is what you do:

Launch an EC2 instance ( you can do this easily on the aws ec2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/e...)

Set up your web server. If you have a Linux instance, this is called Apache, if Windows Server, this is IIS Services. There are many instructions on how to do this on the web.

At this point your website should be up and running but you probably have a long amazon url ( i.e. ec2-175-41-219-186.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com ). The next steps will explain how to associate your GoDaddy domain with the instance.

Allocate an Elastic IP and associate it with your instance. This is really easy and you can do this in AWS EC2 console. Where it says "Networking & Security" on the left, click on "Elastic IPs". Then click "Allocate New Address", then "Associate Address", and select the instance you created in step one.
Now you will have an elastic IP which is a number that looks like 175.41.240.45. Save that number because we will use it later.

Go to the Zone Editor in GoDaddy. Now log into GoDaddy and go to this link: https://dns.godaddy.com/default.... Or from the home page, go to Domains -> My Account -> Domain Management -> DNS Manager. Click "Edit Zone" when it appears.

Associate domain with Elastic IP. In the Zone Editor, you will see several tables. In the table where it says "A (Host)", find the entry where Host = "@". Click on that entry to edit the field for "Points to". Add the elastic IP you just got from Amazon. Click "Save Zone File" when you are done.

6. Complete. After a few minutes your domain should now start resolving to the web server you have on EC2.
